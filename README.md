Welcome to the Synalinks documentation repository! This repo contains comprehensive documentation and resources for building AI-driven applications with the Synalinks framework.

## What is Synalinks?

Synalinks is a powerful framework for building AI-driven programs using large language models (LLMs). It provides a structured approach to defining inputs, outputs, and program logic, making it easier to build, test, and deploy LLM-powered applications.

Key features:
- Structured data modeling for inputs and outputs
- Multiple programming paradigms (functional, class-based, sequential)
- Integration with leading LLM providers
- Comprehensive evaluation and training tools
- Production-ready deployment options
