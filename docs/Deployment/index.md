# Synalinks Deployment Documentation

This section covers various deployment scenarios for Synalinks applications.

## Deployment Options

- [Building a REST API](Building%20a%20REST%20API.md) - Create a FastAPI-based REST API for your Synalinks programs
- [Running on Kubernetes](Running%20on%20Kubernetes.md) - Deploy Synalinks at scale using Kubernetes

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying Synalinks applications to production, consider the following:

### Performance

Synalinks applications can be resource-intensive, especially when working with larger language models. Ensure your deployment environment has:

- Sufficient CPU cores for parallel processing
- Adequate RAM for model loading (8GB+ recommended for most use cases)
- Fast storage for model loading

### Scaling

For high-traffic applications:

1. Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployment
2. Implement a load balancing strategy
3. Consider a microservices architecture where appropriate
4. Utilize caching to reduce redundant model calls

### Security

Because Synalinks applications often process and generate content:

1. Implement robust input validation
2. Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. Validate and sanitize model outputs when necessary
5. Follow security best practices for the deployment platform

### Monitoring

Monitor your Synalinks deployments with:

1. Application metrics (response times, request rates)
2. System metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
3. Error tracking and alerting
4. Regular log analysis

## Environment Setup

A typical production environment for Synalinks might include:

```
SYNALINKS_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/models
SYNALINKS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SYNALINKS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=4
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@postgres/synalinks
```

Set these environment variables according to your deployment platform's requirements.

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test thoroughly in a staging environment
- [ ] Configure appropriate resource limits
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create backup and recovery plans
- [ ] Document deployment procedures
- [ ] Verify security configurations
