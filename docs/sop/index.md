# Standard Operating Procedures

This section outlines the standard operating procedures for building applications using Synalinks.

The procedures are organized into the following sections:

1. [Project Setup](./01-project-setup.md): Setting up your development environment and project structure
2. [Data Models](./02-data-models.md): Creating and using data models to define inputs and outputs
3. [Program Structures](./03-program-structures.md): Building programs with various architectural patterns
4. [Language Models](./04-language-models.md): Integrating and configuring language models
5. [Training and Evaluation](./05-training-and-evaluation.md): Training programs and evaluating their performance
6. [Deployment](./06-deployment.md): Deploying programs to production environments

These SOPs provide a comprehensive guide for developing, training, and deploying Synalinks applications following best practices. They are designed to be followed sequentially for new projects, but can also be referenced individually as needed.

Each SOP includes clear step-by-step instructions, code examples, and explanations to ensure successful implementation regardless of your experience level with Synalinks.
